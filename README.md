# Elm Sketchbook

\*_Quickstart: Clone this project, run npm/yarn install, Install Elm and start using npm/yarn start_

Whether you are a new developer to Elm or an experienced Elm developer, the Elm Sketchbook can unblock you from setting up the boilerplate for proof of concepts. It also provides examples on how to do various tasks.

Elm-Sketchbook was created when I found myself not going further when having to create and setup a new app when I just wanted to try out something new.
With Elm-Sketchbook, you always have a new blank sketch ready that works as a separate app. All sketches can then be navigated with the menu.

This sketchbook comes with 10+ empty sketches and several examples / templates to get you started with Elm or to just experiment with the examples.

    * Sketch out new ideas, always having an empty sketch ready.
    * Learn from, experiment and expand on the the examples
    * Teachers and students - use this as a tool for teaching, learning and experimenting with Elm
    * Package authors. Use the sketchbook as presentation for your package docs
    * Use it as a slide-show where each slide is a separate Elm app.

The examples contain:

    * Basic Html in Elm
    * Use mouse and keyboard with graphics
    * Various Graphics programming examples
    * WebGL in Elm
