# Elm Sketchbook

Whether you are a new developer to Elm or an experienced Elm developer, the Elm Sketchbook wants to unblock you from setting up the boilerplate and provides examples on how to do various tasks.

Elm-Sketchbook was created when I found myself always having to create and setup a new app when trying out something new.
With Elm-Sketchbook, you always have a new blank sketch ready that works as a separate app. All sketches can then be navigated with the menu.

This sketchbook comes with 10+ empty sketches and several examples + templates to get you started with Elm or to just experiment with the examples.

    * Sketch out new ideas, always having an empty sketch ready.
    * Learn from, experiment and expand on the the examples
    * Teachers and students - use this as a tool for teaching, learning and experimenting with Elm
    * Package authors. Use the sketchbook as presentation for your package docs
    * Use it as a slide-show where each slide is a separate Elm app.

The examples contain:

    * Basic Html in Elm
    * Use mouse and keyboard with graphics
    * Various Graphics programming examples
    * WebGL in Elm
    * Want to help? Contribute other examples

Simplify the getting started experience by having features ready:

- Examples
- 10+ empty sketches to start with
- Keyboard and mouse interaction/navigation
- FPS display
- Menu navigation and previous/next sketch
- Many examples to learn from

How to use:

    * Continue with other sketches as needed
    * Edit the menu to show only the sketches you want
    * Remove examples if needed
